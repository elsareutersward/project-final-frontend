# Project Second hand community ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘œ

This project was made as a larger project incorporating both React, Redux, Node.js and MongoDB. The backend part of the project can be found in https://github.com/elsareutersward/project-final-backend.

## The problem

The Second hand community site has a frontend built in React and Redux, and allows the user to log in to buy and sell second hand products. The styling of the site is done with styled components. The site fetches and posts information to a backend built with Node.js and database in MongoDB.
